FaceTrackNoIR (v. 1.6.0).

FaceTrackNoIR is a head-tracker, which uses the FaceAPI provided by SeeingMachines. It was made using Visual Studio 2005 and Qt.
The major advantage over other headtrackers is, that it uses a simple webcam to track the face of 'the gamer'. There is no need 
for expensive equipment or even Borg-like devices with LED's and such.


Installation:
To install the program, simply start Setup.exe and follow the directions. Use the desktop-icon to start FaceTrackNoIR.

Compatibility:
FaceTrackNoIR is made for Windows and tested on XP, Vista and Windows7. The FaceAPI creators recommend a dual-core processor or better. 
Because the 'non-commercial' version of the FaceAPI is used, the webcam can not be 'chosen': it always uses the first webcam it finds! When FaceTrackNoIR is started, the name of this webcam is displayed.


Games:
FaceTrackNoIR supports several protocols, so it can be used with several games, flight-sims and other. Check out the website for a
