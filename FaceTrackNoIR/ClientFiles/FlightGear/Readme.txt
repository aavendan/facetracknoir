FaceTrackNoIR for FlightGear.

FaceTrackNoIR was made compatible with FlightGear with the help of Melchior Franz, who initially made a Linux headtracker. FaceTrackNoIR sends UDP-packets to FlightGear which contain 6DOF-data. The script and protocol provided by Melchior take care of receiving the data and moving 'the head' in-game.

To make the FlightGear script work, copy the files in the subfolders to the corresponding folders in the FlightGear installation folder. Start FlightGear with the batch-file 'start_fg.bat'.


Please let us know if you like the program, if you have ideas for improvements or any questions you might have.
