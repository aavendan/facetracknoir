FaceTrackNoIR (v. 20100822).

From various users we received requests for improvements and features. If you keep sending us your ideas, we can keep
improving FaceTrackNoIR...

Installation:
Unzip all files to the installation folder of FaceTrackNoIR (typicaly c:\program files\abbequerque inc\facetracknoir\): overwrite files when asked.


The following upgrades have been applied:

-	The program-menu now contains a Tools menu. Via this menu the program preferences and keyboard shortcuts can be modified.

-	The preferences dialog contains the 'Auto-minimize' setting: FaceTrackNoIR will minimize x sec. after starting the face-tracker. 
	Entering 0 will disable auto-minimize. This setting is global, for all INI-files.

-	The keyboard shortcuts for 'center' and 'start/stop' can be assigned here. These settings are stored in the INI-file.


Please let us know what you think of our little gadget. Posts can be made on the FaceTrackNoIR forum on SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/facetracknoir/forums/forum/1150910) or on the various game-forums.

If anyone has used FaceTrackNoIR successfully with other games, please let us know. If you can, we would also like to receive
examples of the .INI-file you used for that and maybe settings of other utilities needed. Thanks!
