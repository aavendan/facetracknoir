FaceTrackNoIR (v. 20100716).

From various users we received requests for improvements and features. If you keep sending us your ideas, we can keep
improving FaceTrackNoIR...

Installation:
Unzip the .exe and .dll to the installation folder of FaceTrackNoIR (best rename the old .exe first). The folders in the ZIP-file contain icons for the protocols and an .INI-file (FreeFalcon). Extract these to the folder 'Settings' and 'Images'.


The following upgrades have been applied:

-	TrackIR support is added. Start FaceTrackNoIR and the TrackIR-protocol before starting the game (at least once)..
	A registry-entry is added/changed, that the game or flightsim needs.

Hints from the previous update:
-	‘=’ is center view 

-	‘BACKSPACE’ = start (+center)/stop tracking. A messagebeep is generated when tracking is resumed and the
		      headpose-data is valid again (faceAPI has 'locked on'... ).
	


Please let us know what you think of our little gadget. Posts can be made on the FaceTrackNoIR forum on SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/facetracknoir/forums/forum/1150910) or on the various game-forums.

If anyone has used FaceTrackNoIR successfully with other games, please let us know. If you can, we would also like to receive
examples of the .INI-file you used for that and maybe settings of other utilities needed. Thanks!
